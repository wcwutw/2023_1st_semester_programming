## ADA
The homework in the course "Algorithm Design and Analysis", judge(https://ada-judge.csie.ntu.edu.tw/#!/).

## ICPCpractice
Team practice for ICPC Taoyuan. Only store the codes that were written by me. Won bronze prize eventually :(.

## intro2CS
The homework and final project in the course "Introduction to Computer Science", the final report is completed together with @AAAA-source.

## judgegirl
The code as a tester in the course "Introduction to Computer Programming", judge(https://judgegirl.csie.org/login, should be connected to NTU's VPN).

## ELSE
I also work as a tester in NHSPC mock contest (https://codeforces.com/gym/104830) and a problemsetter for IOICamp 2024 (https://ioicamp.org/).

Some blanks look weird since I use both vim and Codeblocks to type. I would use vim and VS code instead next semester.
